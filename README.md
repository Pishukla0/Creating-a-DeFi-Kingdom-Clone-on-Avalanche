# Creating-a-DeFi-Kingdom-Clone-on-Avalanche


This README provides a guide on setting up an EVM subnet on the Avalanche network, defining a native currency, connecting to Metamask, and deploying the basic building blocks for a DeFi Kingdom clone game.

## Setting Up Your EVM Subnet

1. **Install Avalanche CLI**: Follow the instructions in the Avalanche documentation to install the Avalanche CLI tool.

2. **Create Subnet**: Use the Avalanche CLI to create a new Subnet. This subnet will serve as the foundation for your game.

3. **Create EVM Blockchain**: Within your Subnet, create a new EVM blockchain. This will allow you to deploy Ethereum-compatible smart contracts.

Refer to the Avalanche documentation for detailed steps on each process.

## Define Your Native Currency

1. **Define Currency Specifications**: Decide on the specifications for your native currency, such as name, symbol, and initial supply.

2. **Deploy a Token Contract**: Using Solidity, write a smart contract for your native currency following the ERC-20 standard. Use Remix to compile and deploy your contract to your EVM blockchain.

## Connect to Metamask

1. **Custom RPC Network**: In Metamask, add a new network by selecting "Custom RPC" from the network dropdown.

2. **Network Details**: Enter your EVM blockchain details, including the RPC URL, Chain ID, and currency symbol.

3. **Connect**: Confirm the network addition and connect Metamask to your newly created EVM subnet.

## Deploy Basic Building Blocks

1. **Smart Contracts**: Write Solidity contracts for the core gameplay elements like battling, exploring, and trading. Ensure these contracts interact with each other and with your native currency token.

2. **Compile and Deploy**: Use Remix to compile and deploy these contracts to your EVM subnet. Take note of the contract addresses for frontend integration.

3. **Testing**: Test the contracts using Remix or scripts to ensure they work as expected, simulating gameplay scenarios.

## README Summary

This guide outlines the process of creating a custom EVM subnet on the Avalanche network for a DeFi Kingdom clone game, including defining a native currency, setting up Metamask, and deploying basic game mechanics through smart contracts.

### Prerequisites

- Avalanche CLI installed
- Metamask extension installed
- Solidity and Remix for smart contract development

### Important Steps

1. **Subnet Creation**: Create and configure your EVM subnet on Avalanche.
2. **Native Currency**: Define and deploy your game's native currency.
3. **Metamask Setup**: Connect your subnet to Metamask.
4. **Game Mechanics**: Deploy smart contracts for game mechanics.
